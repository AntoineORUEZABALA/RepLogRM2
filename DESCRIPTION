Description: MIMOSA provides a custom implementation of logistic regression models, 
  supporting both binary and multinomial classification tasks. The package 
  handles explanatory variables of mixed types, including both quantitative 
  and qualitative variables. It includes preprocessing utilities for missing 
  value imputation, one-hot encoding of categorical variables, and normalization 
  of numerical variables. Designed for flexibility and ease of use, MIMOSA is 
  suitable for a wide range of logistic regression applications.
