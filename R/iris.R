#' Iris Dataset
#'
#' The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, used frequently for classification
#' and clustering algorithms. It contains measurements for three species of Iris flowers
#' (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica).
#'
#' @format A data frame with 150 rows and 5 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{Sepal.Length}{Length of the sepal in centimeters (numeric).}
#'   \item{Sepal.Width}{Width of the sepal in centimeters (numeric).}
#'   \item{Petal.Length}{Length of the petal in centimeters (numeric).}
#'   \item{Petal.Width}{Width of the petal in centimeters (numeric).}
#'   \item{Species}{Species of the Iris flower: \code{"setosa"}, \code{"versicolor"}, \code{"virginica"} (factor).}
#' }
#'
#' @details
#' This dataset was introduced by Ronald A. Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements
#' in taxonomic problems". It is widely used as a beginner's dataset in data science and machine learning.

#' @source
#' Originally collected by Edgar Anderson and analyzed by Ronald A. Fisher.
#' Dataset is available in the \code{datasets} package in R.
