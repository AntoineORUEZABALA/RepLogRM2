\description{
This dataset contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
The features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
The dataset is frequently used for binary classification problems, predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
}
\details{
The features are computed as the mean, standard error, and "worst" (largest of the mean of the three largest values)
for each cell nucleus characteristic. The dataset has no missing values.
